title: "Lab 1: Board Assembly and Test"
---
## TL;DR
The main goal of this assignement was to familiarize myself with all the tools that I will be using this semester. In this lab, I soldered and tested my development board. I also installed all the software programs I will need, making my GitHub repositories, and learned what the workflow is. Finally, I dusted off my SystemVerilog skills by programming a seven-segment LED display that will display all the hex digits (0x0 to 0xF).

## Design Approach
To design the seven-segment display, I started with the given inputs and outputs of the system. My block diagram looks like this:

The full schematic looks like this. I realized after I finished that I had done the current limiting resistor incorrectly- there should be one on each signal line, and the 3.3V to the common anode should not have one.

## Testing Approach
I tested my System Verilog manually by forcing s to each of the values, then comparing seg[6:0] to what it should be. The waveform looks like this:

Note that the led signal is bad. This is because I didn't properly integrate the HSOSC with the testbench. Since the code was reused from a previous demo project, I was willing to try on hardware rather than continue to simulate this time, but going forward I would fix this before moving on.

## Requirements
My lab meets the following requirements:
- 

Number of hours spent: 15

## Comments for next time
I thought that I had started early enough, but I was incorrect! Part of that might have been the fact that I spent somewhere around 5-6 hours on the quarto assignement from the first week, which ate into my time for this lab. I'm fixing this problem by starting earlier this upcoming week. 
Also, I learned that reading over the lab specs will not give me a full idea of what the lab entails - I was excited to get started on my seven-segment display and the amount of demo tutorials hidden under the heading "Testing Your Board" caught me off guard. I'm fixing this issue by printing the lab on paper next week so I can see the whole thing and gauge accordingly.
