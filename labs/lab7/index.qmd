title: Lab 7 - The Advanced Encryption Standard
---
## Summary

The main goals of this assignment were to understand how the Advanced Encryption Standard(AES) works and to implement it from scratch on an FPGA.\

## Design and Testing Methodology
This design implements the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), specifically AES-128. It takes a 128-bit plaintext and a 128-bit key and returns the 128-bit ciphertext. The MCU sends the key and plaintext to the FPGA, which actually implements it in both combinational and sequential logic before returning the ciphertext to the MCU. The MCU also checks the encryption. The communication happens over SPI, using a link that was provided in the lab.

Using the hint, I designed my system to be a controller and datapath structure. For each step of the AES pseudocode, I wrote a separate module with its own enable line. By selectively enabling them each round, I can control which steps happen when using which keys.

## Conclusion
The design works as intended to implement AES on an FPGA. I spent roughly 17 hours on this lab. (Fri: 2, Sat: 3.5, Sun: 6.5, Mon: 5).
