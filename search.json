The waveform looks like this:  Note that the led signal is bad. This is because I didn’t properly integrate the HSOSC with the testbench. Since the code was reused from a previous demo project, I was willing to try on hardware rather than continue to simulate this time, but going forward I would fix this before moving on."

Perhaps more realistically, I would like to understand the basics of programming FPGAs (and why it is complicated enough to be a complete job title). I also want to get more hands-on practice with digital design and to make a cool project that I can show off to my friends at Demo Day.\nNote: I’m already learning things! Thing #1: While making this website, I learned that whitespaces can mess up markdown. Thing #2: I avoided a problem with Github Authentication by choosing the coward’s route and using github desktop. Really, I probably have three or four half-understood and ill-advised config settings from previous projects over the lifetime of this laptop and I suspect to address the root causes I should wipe it and start fresh."
