    "text": "At the beginning of the semester, I said that I wanted to develop better judgement. A week later, the judgement was more so a technical skill that I hoped to develop by gaining familiarity with all the pieces that go into being a digital designer. I imagined that I would neutrally know what everything should do and how to make it do that. This was probably a naive way to conceptualize this trait. Really, judgement will comes as I make mistakes. This isn’t the first time I’ve come across this thought, but it is the difference in mindset between a start of year prompt (when the world is wide open) and 15 hours in the lab later. I’m okay with making mistakes, but I think I should start making them sooner and faster and stop making the same ones (looking at you, GitHub). Hardly groundbreaking, but I seem to have to relearn it more often than I care to admit.\nAnyhow, I remembered as I was working how much I enjoyed working with Verilog back in E85. Programming is fine, but I appreciate that this is not programming - it is hardware designing. I like how I can design each module and then all I have to do is put them in the same place with the same signal names. It’s like breadboarding, but better: I don’t have to flip back and forth between two datasheets to get all the correct pin numbers. My goal for this upcoming week is to learn how to write a testbench."

I could do this by changing one of the transistors to be active low instead of active high and connecting the same digit selection signal to the gates of the transistors for both anodes. Also, it wouldn’t hurt to use a synchronizer for the inputs."

(Fri: 4, Sat: 5, Sun: 3, Mon: 2)\nLicensing really sucks - I wish we had used our first week’s lab time to do a synchronous (with Prof) downloading session and also demo it once for the group before we each followed the written demos on our own. I think I would’ve known better what to expect and I keep learning things that weren’t in the instructions but that are kind of important. Case in point: if you have a testbench, you have to specify not to synthesize it. I understood it conceptually from class but didn’t know how to actually disntinguish between non- and synthesizable modules in Radiant."

The waveform looks like this:  Note that the led signal is bad. This is because I didn’t properly integrate the HSOSC with the testbench. Since the code was reused from a previous demo project, I was willing to try on hardware rather than continue to simulate this time, but going forward I would fix this before moving on."

(e.g., the switch for bit 0 is next to the switch for bit 1, which is next to the switch for bit 2, etc.) - LEDs display the specified logic operations properly.\nNumber of hours spent: 15"

Part of that might have been the fact that I spent somewhere around 5-6 hours on the quarto assignement from the first week, which ate into my time for this lab. I’m fixing this problem by starting earlier this upcoming week. Also, I learned that reading over the lab specs will not give me a full idea of what the lab entails - I was excited to get started on my seven-segment display and the amount of demo tutorials hidden under the heading “Testing Your Board” caught me off guard. I’m fixing this issue by printing the lab on paper next week so I can see the whole thing and gauge accordingly."

I also want to get more hands-on practice with digital design and to make a cool project that I can show off to my friends at Demo Day.\nNote: I’m already learning things! Thing #1: While making this website, I learned that whitespaces can mess up markdown. Thing #2: I avoided a problem with Github Authentication by choosing the coward’s route and using github desktop. Really, I probably have three or four half-understood and ill-advised config settings from previous projects over the lifetime of this laptop and I suspect to address the root causes I should wipe it and start fresh."
